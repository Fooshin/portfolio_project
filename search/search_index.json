The reasons I am pivoting at this point are multi-faceted, however I have always had a deep fascination with the IT/tech space and have kept up with various topics that have interested me over the years. I honestly love learning and seeing how things work. IT has so many moving parts, and it is humbling to be forced to start from scratch. But I am motivated and excited by the things I have been working on. There is nothing more satisfying than troubleshooting, learning, and then getting a tool to work. My other main interests include spending time with my wife and four children, cooking, learning languages, and playing chess!</p>"},{"location":"#this-portfolio-page","title":"This Portfolio Page","text":"<p>I should mention, that even creating this portfolio page is worth talking about. While I was in the process of wondering how to best display my portfolio for cybersecurity, I came across MKDocs as a potential tool to learn. This sent me down a rabbit trail of implementing this website as something that could hosted on Github for potential employers to review. I spent a lengthy process configuring, debugging, editing, reading the documentation, and implementing this framework; and I am super pleased with the initial results! During the process I came into contact with a bunch of things that I thought leveraged my ability to learn and grow by actually applying tools and concepts.

Set up controls and properly configure to harden the server from vulnerable access. Next, add layers of implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users access the database server. These may include enforcing stronger passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Add encryption of data in motion using TLS instead of SSL. Upgrading and auditing firewalls and IDPs to detect suspicious behavior, as well as monitoring and incident response strategies would be recommended.</p>"},{"location":"python/","title":"Some Automation Code with Pyton","text":""},{"location":"python/#code-snippet-1","title":"Code Snippet 1","text":"<p>The python code below represents a culmination of putting together various python concepts.

Will there be collecting of data for marketing that will need to be protected? Will the company hold login credentials that give access to C.C information? What are the regulations about handling the data based on where they are in the world? How will customers and employees see each others data during customer service help sessions II.Define the technical scope I would prioritize SQL injection threats based on the vulnerabilites of this company. Additionally, systems should be checked for correct configuration across this model analysis. III.Decompose Application Sample data flow diagram IV.Threat analysis Based on the information given, the largest looming threat are SQL injections through user requests for searches to the database. Threat actors may also acquire hash functions that have not been properly salted. An assessement and audit for authorization should be standardized to ensure employees can only access and view sensitive data from the database for isolated customer service situations. V.Vulnerability Analysis Poorly written code or code review practices can allow for injections into the website to gain knowledge of the database. If the server has also not been properly hardened or configured, other network protocols could be used to attack customers and launch malware attacks.
