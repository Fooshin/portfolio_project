# Welcome to My Portfolio

**Thank you so much for visiting.** While I have enabled light/dark mode on this site with the toggle button near the search bar; I personally think the website looks much nicer in dark mode and has far greater legibility.

!!! note
    ### This page is growing, and projects I believe worth mentioning can be found on the **top** navigation bar. I plan to create a blog section later to document my experience of searching for a cybersecurity role.

## About Me

I have recently left my previous role as an associate pastor and I am looking to begin a career in cybersecurity. The reasons I am pivoting at this point are multi-faceted, however I have always had a deep fascination with the IT/tech space and have kept up with various topics that have interested me over the years. I honestly love learning and seeing how things work. IT has so many moving parts, and it is humbling to be forced to start from scratch. But I am motivated and excited by the things I have been working on. There is nothing more satisfying than troubleshooting, learning, and then getting a tool to work. My other main interests include spending time with my wife and four children, cooking, learning languages, and playing chess!

## This Portfolio Page

I should mention, that even creating this portfolio page is worth talking about. While I was in the process of wondering how to best display my portfolio for cybersecurity, I came across MKDocs as a potential tool to learn. This sent me down a rabbit trail of implementing this website as something that could hosted on Github for potential employers to review. I spent a lengthy process configuring, debugging, editing, reading the documentation, and implementing this framework; and I am **super** _pleased_ with the initial results! During the process I came into contact with a bunch of things that I thought leveraged my ability to learn and grow by actually applying tools and concepts. Here a few things I became exposed to during the setup.

* Git
* Github
* Visual Code
* Additional Python concepts
* Debugging/Troubleshooting
* MkDocs

## Currently Working On (as of 10/14/23)

* Comptia Security + Certification
* Wazuh SIEM tool
* Furthering my understanding about Network Infrastructures
* Hack the Box CTFs
* Linux Tutorials
